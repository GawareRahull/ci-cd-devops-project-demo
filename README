# 🚀 CI/CD DevOps Project Demo

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a complete **CI/CD pipeline** implementation for a **Node.js application** using **Jenkins**, **Docker**, and deployed on **AWS EC2**.

Any change pushed to this GitHub repository triggers the Jenkins pipeline, which builds a Docker image, pushes it to DockerHub, and deploys the application container on AWS EC2.

</p>

The above diagram shows how code flows from the developer to production:
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub.
2. GitHub triggers the Jenkins job.
3. Jenkins builds and pushes a Docker image.
4. Jenkins deploys the container on the EC2 instance.
5. Application is served to users via public IP and port.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Flow

### 1️⃣ Code Versioning

- The Node.js application code is stored in GitHub.
- Jenkins monitors the `main` branch for changes.

### 2️⃣ Checkout and Build

Jenkins pulls the latest code:

Then builds a Docker image using the `Dockerfile`.

---

### 3️⃣ Docker Image Build

Docker builds the image:

```bash
docker build -t rahulgaware/ci-cd-devops-demo .

Jenkins uses this image to run the app.

4️⃣ Docker Login

Jenkins logs in to DockerHub using stored credentials.

5️⃣ Docker Push

The built image is pushed to DockerHub.

6️⃣ Deployment

Before deploying new container, Jenkins:

Stops old container (if running).

Removes old container.

Then runs the new container:

docker run -d -p 8081:3000 --name ci-container rahulgaware/ci-cd-devops-demo


The application is now accessible at:

http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8081

📌 How to Access the Application

After successful deployment, open in browser:

http://<EC2-IP>:8081
