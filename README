Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application using Jenkins and Docker deployed on AWS EC2
The pipeline automatically builds and deploys the application whenever code is pushed to GitHub.

Architecture



The application follows the below architecture:

Developer pushes code to GitHub

Jenkins automatically triggers pipeline

Docker image is built

Old container is stopped

New container is deployed

Application is accessible via EC2 public IP

🛠 Technologies Used

Node.js

Docker

Jenkins

Git & GitHub

AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)

🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Flow
Stage 1 – Code Checkout

Jenkins pulls latest code from GitHub repository.

Stage 2 – Docker Build

Docker image is built using Dockerfile.

docker build -t ci-cd-demo .

Stage 3 – Stop Old Container
docker stop ci-container || true
docker rm ci-container || true

Stage 4 – Deploy New Container
docker run -d -p 8081:3000 --name ci-container ci-cd-demo
